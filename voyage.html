        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
        
        <p><em>The perfect trip</em> would be somewhere warm and beautiful, somewhere with nice beaches, nice restaurants and a lot of fun activities to do.</p>
        
        <p>I would like to go to a trip with all my friends and just discover and try things we've never tried before. I would take a lot of photos and videos to keep for memory.</p>
        
        <p>My friends and I would definetly enjoy going to fancy restaurents and try new foods. We would also love doing new activities that we woluldnt usually do like rock climbing, sky diving or going on a hike. <strong>It's all about making memories.</strong> </p>
